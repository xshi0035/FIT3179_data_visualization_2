                    This map visualizes the Total CO2 equivalent emissions across Australia’s states from 1990 to 2020. 
                    The emissions data is categorized by five major contributing factors: energy consumption, industrial processes, 
                    agriculture, land use and land-use changes (including forestry), and waste management. Each state's emissions level 
                    reflects the combined impact of these activities, offering insights into how various sectors have contributed to greenhouse gas emissions over time. 
                    By selecting different years, you can easily observe how the colors change, reflecting shifts in emissions across regions and the activities that have influenced these variations

                    This bubble chart represents Australia's renewable energy consumption by fuel type and industry from various categories. The size of each bubble reflects the consumption level of a particular fuel source or energy-related activity. Categories include traditional fuels such as biomass, biofuels, and biogas, as well as renewable energy sources like wind, hydro, and solar power. Other sectors, such as agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and residential, show how these industries contribute to energy consumption. By examining the chart, you can gain insights into the diverse energy sources fueling Australian industries and how their usage has evolved over time.
